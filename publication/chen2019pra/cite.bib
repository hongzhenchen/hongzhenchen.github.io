 title = {Optimal joint estimation of multiple Rabi frequencies},
 abstract = {We study the joint estimation of multiple Rabi frequencies in a multilevel system. By analytically identifying the optimal probe state and the optimal measurement, we obtain the highest precision limit for the joint estimation of multiple Rabi frequencies. We show that the joint estimation does not always outperform the separate estimation. In different regimes the joint estimation can either outperform or underperform the separate estimation. We further show that if additional adaptive quantum controls are allowed then the advantage of the joint estimation over the separate estimation can be reestablished.},
