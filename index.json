Understanding the tradeoff induced by such incompatibility is a central topic in quantum metrology. Here we provide an approach to study the incompatibility under general $p$-local measurements, which are the measurements that can be performed collectively on at most $p$ copies of quantum states. We demonstrate the power of the approach by presenting a hierarchy of analytical bounds on the tradeoff among the precisions of different parameters. These bounds lead to a necessary condition for the saturation of the quantum Cramér-Rao bound under $p$-local measurements, which recovers the partial commutative condition at $p=1$ and the weak commutative condition at $p=\\infty$. As a further demonstration of the power of the framework, we present another set of tradeoff relations with the right logarithmic operators.","tags":["quantum metrology","quantum measurement"],"title":"Incompatibility measures in multiparameter quantum estimation under hierarchical quantum measurements","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongzhen Chen","Yu Chen","Haidong Yuan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1656028800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1656028800,"objectID":"cb39ff37ab6f6e9cfba85c3a7b6a681e","permalink":"https://hzchen.me/publication/chen2022prl/","publishdate":"2022-06-24T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen2022prl/","section":"publication","summary":"In most quantum technologies, measurements need to be performed on the parametrized quantum states to transform the quantum information to classical information. The measurements, however, inevitably distort the information. The characterization of the discrepancy is an important subject in quantum information science, which plays a key role in understanding the difference between the structures of quantum and classical informations. Here we analyze the difference in terms of the Fisher information metric and present a framework that can provide analytical bounds on the discrepancy under hierarchical quantum measurements. Specifically, we present a set of analytical bounds on the difference between the quantum and classical Fisher information metric under hierarchical $p$-local quantum measurements, which are measurements that can be performed collectively on at most $p$ copies of quantum states. The results can be directly transformed to the precision limit in multiparameter quantum metrology, which leads to characterizations of the trade-off among the precision of different parameters. The framework also provides a coherent picture for various existing results by including them as special cases.","tags":["quantum metrology","quantum measurement"],"title":"Information Geometry under Hierarchical Quantum Measurement","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jing Liu","Mao Zhang","Hongzhen Chen","Lingna Wang","Haidong Yuan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1637625600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637625600,"objectID":"71f710fe4f7d6197a725b3dcc005998e","permalink":"https://hzchen.me/publication/liu2022qute/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu2022qute/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantum metrology can achieve far better precision than classical metrology, and is one of the most important applications of quantum technologies in the real world. To attain the highest precision promised by quantum metrology, all steps of the schemes need to be optimized, which include the state preparation, parametrization, and measurement. Here the recent progresses on the optimization of these steps, which are essential for the identification and achievement of the ultimate precision limit in quantum metrology, are reviewed.

Better scalings, dubbed as \\\"super-Heisenberg scaling,\\\" however, can also arise when the generator of the parameter involves many-body interactions or when it is time dependent. All these different scalings can actually be seen as manifestations of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. While there is only one best scaling in the single-parameter quantum metrology, different scalings can coexist for the estimation of multiple parameters, which can be characterized by multiple Heisenberg uncertainty relations. We demonstrate the coexistence of two different scalings via the simultaneous estimation of the magnitude and frequency of a field where the best precisions, characterized by two Heisenberg uncertainty relations, scale as T^-1 and T^-2, respectively (in terms of the standard deviation). We show that the simultaneous saturation of two Heisenberg uncertainty relations can be achieved by the optimal protocol, which prepares the optimal probe state, implements the optimal control, and performs the optimal measurement. The optimal protocol is experimentally implemented on an optical platform that demonstrates the saturation of the two Heisenberg uncertainty relations simultaneously, with up to five controls. As the first demonstration of simultaneously achieving two different Heisenberg scalings, our study deepens the understanding on the connection between the precision limit and the uncertainty relations, which has wide implications in practical applications of multiparameter quantum estimation.","tags":["quantum metrology","quantum control"],"title":"''Super-Heisenberg'' and Heisenberg Scalings Achieved Simultaneously in the Estimation of a Rotating Field","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhibo Hou","Jun-Feng Tang","Hongzhen Chen","Haidong Yuan","Guo-Yong Xiang","Chuan-Feng Li","Guang-Can Guo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"86d9a41be89b9cbc6fa086f418e1e5b3","permalink":"https://hzchen.me/publication/hou2021sciadv/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hou2021sciadv/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantum estimation of a single parameter has been studied extensively. Practical applications, however, typically involve multiple parameters, for which the ultimate precision is much less understood. Here, by relating the precision limit directly to the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, we show that to achieve the highest precisions for multiple parameters at the same time requires the saturation of multiple Heisenberg uncertainty relations simultaneously. Guided by this insight, we experimentally demonstrate an optimally controlled multipass scheme, which saturates three Heisenberg uncertainty relations simultaneously and achieves the highest precisions for the estimation of all three parameters in SU(2) operators. With eight controls, we achieve a 13.27-dB improvement in terms of the variance (6.63 dB for the SD) over the classical scheme with the same loss. As an experiment demonstrating the simultaneous achievement of the ultimate precisions for multiple parameters, our work marks an important step in multiparameter quantum metrology with wide implications.","tags":["quantum metrology","quantum control"],"title":"Zero–trade-off multiparameter quantum estimation via simultaneously saturating multiple Heisenberg uncertainty relations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhibo Hou","Zhao Zhang","Guo-Yong Xiang","Chuan-Feng Li","Guang-Can Guo","Hongzhen Chen","Liqiang Liu","Haidong Yuan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1594166400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594166400,"objectID":"13dc7ff8b5ecfeef2294fad3affc2f77","permalink":"https://hzchen.me/publication/hou2020prl/","publishdate":"2020-07-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hou2020prl/","section":"publication","summary":"The precise measurement of a magnetic field is one of the most fundamental and important tasks in quantum metrology. Although extensive studies on quantum magnetometry have been carried out over past decades, the ultimate precision that can be achieved for the estimation of all three components of a magnetic field under the parallel scheme remains unknown. This is largely due to the lack of understandings on the incompatibility of the optimal probe states for the estimation of the three components. Here we provide an approach to characterize the minimal tradeoff among the precisions of multiple parameters that arise from the incompatibility of the optimal probe states, which leads to the identification of the ultimate precision limit for the estimation of all three components of a magnetic field under the parallel scheme. The optimal probe state that achieves the ultimate precision is also explicitly constructed. The obtained precision sets a benchmark on the precision of the multiparameter quantum magnetometry under the parallel scheme, which is of fundamental interest and importance in quantum metrology.","tags":["quantum metrology"],"title":"Minimal Tradeoff and Ultimate Precision Limit of Multiparameter Quantum Magnetometry under the Parallel Scheme","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Chen","Hongzhen Chen","Jing Liu","Zibo Miao","Haidong Yuan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"8fb9566a7beeab73df485df50a07376c","permalink":"https://hzchen.me/publication/chen2020arxiv/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen2020arxiv/","section":"publication","summary":"The main obstacle for practical quantum technology is the noise, which can induce the decoherence and destroy the potential quantum advantages. The fluctuation of a field, which induces the dephasing of the system, is one of the most common noises and widely regarded as detrimental to quantum technologies. Here we show, contrary to the conventional belief, the fluctuation can be used to improve the precision limits in quantum metrology for the estimation of various parameters. Specifically, we show that for the estimation of the direction and rotating frequency of a field, the achieved precisions at the presence of the fluctuation can even surpass the highest precision achievable under the unitary dynamics which have been widely taken as the ultimate limit. We provide explicit protocols, which employs the adaptive quantum error correction, to achieve the higher precision limits with the fluctuating fields. Our study provides a completely new perspective on the role of the noises in quantum metrology.
