In practice, however, the collective measurements are always restricted to a finite number of quantum states, under which the precision limit is still poorly understood. Here we provide an approach to study the multi-parameter quantum estimation with general $p$-local measurement where the collective measurements are restricted to at most $p$ copies of quantum states. We demonstrate the power of the approach by providing a hierarchy of nontrivial tradeoff relations for multi-parameter quantum estimation which quantify the incompatibilities of general $p$-local measurement. These tradeoff relations also provide a necessary condition for the saturation of the quantum Cramér-Rao bound under $p$-local measurement, which is shown reducing to the weak commutative condition when $p\\rightarrow \\infty$. To further demonstrate the versatility of the approach, we also derive another set of tradeoff relations in terms of the right logarithmic operators(RLD).","tags":["quantum metrology","quantum measurement"],"title":"Hierarchical incompatibility measures in multi-parameter quantum estimation","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Jing Liu","Mao Zhang","Hongzhen Chen","Lingna Wang","Haidong Yuan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1637625600,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1637625600,"objectID":"71f710fe4f7d6197a725b3dcc005998e","permalink":"https://hongzhenchen.github.io/publication/liu2022qute/","publishdate":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/liu2022qute/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantum metrology can achieve far better precision than classical metrology, and is one of the most important applications of quantum technologies in the real world.

Better scalings, dubbed as \\\"super-Heisenberg scaling,\\\" however, can also arise when the generator of the parameter involves many-body interactions or when it is time dependent. All these different scalings can actually be seen as manifestations of the Heisenberg uncertainty relations. While there is only one best scaling in the single-parameter quantum metrology, different scalings can coexist for the estimation of multiple parameters, which can be characterized by multiple Heisenberg uncertainty relations. We demonstrate the coexistence of two different scalings via the simultaneous estimation of the magnitude and frequency of a field where the best precisions, characterized by two Heisenberg uncertainty relations, scale as T^-1 and T^-2, respectively (in terms of the standard deviation). We show that the simultaneous saturation of two Heisenberg uncertainty relations can be achieved by the optimal protocol, which prepares the optimal probe state, implements the optimal control, and performs the optimal measurement. The optimal protocol is experimentally implemented on an optical platform that demonstrates the saturation of the two Heisenberg uncertainty relations simultaneously, with up to five controls. As the first demonstration of simultaneously achieving two different Heisenberg scalings, our study deepens the understanding on the connection between the precision limit and the uncertainty relations, which has wide implications in practical applications of multiparameter quantum estimation.","tags":["quantum metrology","quantum control"],"title":"''Super-Heisenberg'' and Heisenberg Scalings Achieved Simultaneously in the Estimation of a Rotating Field","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhibo Hou","Jun-Feng Tang","Hongzhen Chen","Haidong Yuan","Guo-Yong Xiang","Chuan-Feng Li","Guang-Can Guo"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1609459200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1609459200,"objectID":"86d9a41be89b9cbc6fa086f418e1e5b3","permalink":"https://hongzhenchen.github.io/publication/hou2021sciadv/","publishdate":"2021-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hou2021sciadv/","section":"publication","summary":"Quantum estimation of a single parameter has been studied extensively. Practical applications, however, typically involve multiple parameters, for which the ultimate precision is much less understood. Here, by relating the precision limit directly to the Heisenberg uncertainty relation, we show that to achieve the highest precisions for multiple parameters at the same time requires the saturation of multiple Heisenberg uncertainty relations simultaneously. Guided by this insight, we experimentally demonstrate an optimally controlled multipass scheme, which saturates three Heisenberg uncertainty relations simultaneously and achieves the highest precisions for the estimation of all three parameters in SU(2) operators. With eight controls, we achieve a 13.27-dB improvement in terms of the variance (6.63 dB for the SD) over the classical scheme with the same loss. As an experiment demonstrating the simultaneous achievement of the ultimate precisions for multiple parameters, our work marks an important step in multiparameter quantum metrology with wide implications.","tags":["quantum metrology","quantum control"],"title":"Zero–trade-off multiparameter quantum estimation via simultaneously saturating multiple Heisenberg uncertainty relations","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Zhibo Hou","Zhao Zhang","Guo-Yong Xiang","Chuan-Feng Li","Guang-Can Guo","Hongzhen Chen","Liqiang Liu","Haidong Yuan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1594166400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1594166400,"objectID":"13dc7ff8b5ecfeef2294fad3affc2f77","permalink":"https://hongzhenchen.github.io/publication/hou2020prl/","publishdate":"2020-07-08T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/hou2020prl/","section":"publication","summary":"The precise measurement of a magnetic field is one of the most fundamental and important tasks in quantum metrology. Although extensive studies on quantum magnetometry have been carried out over past decades, the ultimate precision that can be achieved for the estimation of all three components of a magnetic field under the parallel scheme remains unknown. This is largely due to the lack of understandings on the incompatibility of the optimal probe states for the estimation of the three components. Here we provide an approach to characterize the minimal tradeoff among the precisions of multiple parameters that arise from the incompatibility of the optimal probe states, which leads to the identification of the ultimate precision limit for the estimation of all three components of a magnetic field under the parallel scheme. The optimal probe state that achieves the ultimate precision is also explicitly constructed. The obtained precision sets a benchmark on the precision of the multiparameter quantum magnetometry under the parallel scheme, which is of fundamental interest and importance in quantum metrology.","tags":["quantum metrology"],"title":"Minimal Tradeoff and Ultimate Precision Limit of Multiparameter Quantum Magnetometry under the Parallel Scheme","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Yu Chen","Hongzhen Chen","Jing Liu","Zibo Miao","Haidong Yuan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1583020800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1583020800,"objectID":"8fb9566a7beeab73df485df50a07376c","permalink":"https://hongzhenchen.github.io/publication/chen2020arxiv/","publishdate":"2020-03-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen2020arxiv/","section":"publication","summary":"The main obstacle for practical quantum technology is the noise, which can induce the decoherence and destroy the potential quantum advantages. The fluctuation of a field, which induces the dephasing of the system, is one of the most common noises and widely regarded as detrimental to quantum technologies. Here we show, contrary to the conventional belief, the fluctuation can be used to improve the precision limits in quantum metrology for the estimation of various parameters. Specifically, we show that for the estimation of the direction and rotating frequency of a field, the achieved precisions at the presence of the fluctuation can even surpass the highest precision achievable under the unitary dynamics which have been widely taken as the ultimate limit. We provide explicit protocols, which employs the adaptive quantum error correction, to achieve the higher precision limits with the fluctuating fields. Our study provides a completely new perspective on the role of the noises in quantum metrology. It also opens the door for higher precisions beyond the limit that has been believed to be ultimate.","tags":["quantum metrology","quantum control"],"title":"Fluctuation-enhanced quantum metrology","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Hongzhen Chen","Haidong Yuan"],"categories":[],"content":"","date":1553558400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1553558400,"objectID":"783e1c4c4d43b47184b01c01851cdd36","permalink":"https://hongzhenchen.github.io/publication/chen2019pra/","publishdate":"2019-03-26T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/publication/chen2019pra/","section":"publication","summary":"We study the joint estimation of multiple Rabi frequencies in a multilevel system.
